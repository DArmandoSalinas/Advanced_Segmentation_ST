    "**🔧 Analysis Pipeline:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading & Column Resolution**\n",
    "   - Load from `contacts_campus_Qro_.csv`\n",
    "   - Map HubSpot property names to canonical column names\n",
    "   - Handle multiple alias patterns for each field\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Historical Data Parsing** \n",
    "   - Parse HubSpot's `//` delimited history strings (e.g., `\"value1//value2//value3\"`)\n",
    "   - Create `*_hist_all` columns with ALL historical values concatenated\n",
    "   - Maintain latest values for comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Platform Signal Extraction** \n",
    "   - Scan 12 text fields (6 historical + 6 latest) for platform keywords\n",
    "   - Create `platform_count_*` columns for each of 12 platforms\n",
    "   - Count total mentions (`platform_mentions_total`) and diversity (`platform_diversity`)\n",
    "   - Result: Majority of contacts have platform signals, some with 2+ platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Contact Filtering**\n",
    "   - Filter for `Propiedad del contacto = \"APREU\"`\n",
    "   - Exclude lifecycle stages: \"Other\" and \"subscriber\"\n",
    "   - Convert HubSpot timestamps (milliseconds) to datetime objects\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cohort Definition**\n",
    "   - Define \"socially engaged\" using THREE criteria (ANY must match):\n",
    "     * Social clicks > 0\n",
    "     * Platform mentions from historical text analysis\n",
    "     * Social keywords in source/referrer fields\n",

    "   - Efficiency ratios: `pageviews_per_session`, `forms_per_session`, `forms_per_click`\n",
    "   - Replace inf/NaN from divisions with 0\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Categorical Preprocessing**\n",
    "   - Normalize text fields (handle \"nan\", empty strings)\n",
    "   - Extract domains from referrer URLs\n",
    "   - Cap to Top-50 per categorical field (prevents sparse one-hot explosion)\n",
    "   - One-hot encode categorical features\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Clustering (KMeans k=2)**\n",
    "   - Scale numeric features (7 features: logs + ratios)\n",
    "   - Fit KMeans on scaled numeric matrix\n",
    "   - Label clusters based on combined engagement+social intensity\n",
    "   - Cluster 1A = Higher score → \"High Engagement\"\n",

    "   - **Priority 1 (PRIMARY)**: Historical mention counts from `platform_count_*` columns\n",
    "     * Covers 12+ platforms vs only 3 for clicks\n",
    "     * Uses ALL contact history (not just recent)\n",
    "     * Majority of contacts have this signal\n",
    "   - **Priority 2 (BOOST)**: Clicks add 30% weight to historical signal (validation)\n",
    "     * Formula: `score = mentions * (1 + click_share * 0.3)`\n",
    "   - **Priority 3 (FALLBACK)**: Strong click signal (≥70%) when NO historical data\n",
    "   - **Priority 4 (LAST RESORT)**: Text keyword guess from latest source fields\n",
    "   - Result: Each contact gets dominant platform tag or \"Mixed\"\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Overlay Segment Creation**\n",
    "    - Combine engagement level + platform tag\n",
    "    - Format: `\"1A + Facebook\"`, `\"1B + LinkedIn\"`, `\"1A + Mixed\"`, etc.\n",
    "    - Creates granular segments for targeted actions\n",
